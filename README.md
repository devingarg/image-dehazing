Exploring Image Dehazing

## Datasets
We work with the following datasets:

- O-Haze: available [here](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire18/o-haze/) 
- RESIDE: available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-%CE%B2)
- D-HAZY: available [here](https://ancuti.meo.etc.upt.ro/D_Hazzy_ICIP2016/)

## Techniques 
We implement the following techniques to perform image dehazing on these datasets:

### Dehazing using dark channel prior [^1]

This is a classical technique put forth by He _et al._ in [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206515) paper.


### A deep-learning based technique 

This is going to be a deep-learning based technique employing a novel architecture that we will come up with.
